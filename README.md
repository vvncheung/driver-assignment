# driver-assignment
 This project was (a lot of fun!) to build with React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
 
 Other packages used includes:
 - React Hook Form
 - Font Awesome

## Set up for viewing
- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command) in main directory
- Run the server: run the development web server using the `npm start` command in the server folder
- Run the client: run the development client using the `npx nodemon` command in the client folder
- If the app does not run automatically, browse to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser of choice (Chrome recommended!)

## Known bugs:
- Occasional stutter after dropping item in new column
- Drag and drop will succeed only if dropped on top of 'drag' button
