# driver-assignment
 This project was (a lot of fun!) to build with React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
 
 Other dependencies include:
 - React-Hook-Form
 - Font Awesome
 - Axios

## Set up for viewing
- Fork and clone this repository
- Use the `npm install` command in the root directory to install dependencies
- Run the server: run the development web server using the `npm start` command from within the server directory
- Run the client: run the development client using the `npx nodemon` command from within the client directory
- If the app does not run automatically, browse to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser of choice (Chrome recommended!)

## Known bugs:
- Occasional stutter after dropping item in new column
- Drag and drop of record will succeed only if dropped on top of 'drag' icon on top of intended placement
